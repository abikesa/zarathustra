    "\n",
    "This book explores the essence of what makes us human, framed by three symbolic pillars: a lyre, a roulette wheel, and a spear. These symbols represent essential stages of existence: paradise, earth, and hell. Life is fundamentally a negotiation in suspense—caught between beauty and injury, serenity and struggle, certainty and risk. We are guided by wisdom, symbolized by a book, and folly, embodied by the roulette wheel. The journey from animal to man to Übermensch is marked by obstacles and crises that challenge and define us.\n",

    "The lyre symbolizes paradise, where the soul, like David’s harp, resonates in harmony with the divine. Yet, paradise alone is not the whole of life; without suspense and challenge, the soul would stagnate. The spear represents hell, confronting our fears and inner adversaries with unwavering resolve. Between these extremes lies the roulette wheel—a symbol of life’s gamble on earth, where suspense holds sway, and chance and choice intertwine.\n",

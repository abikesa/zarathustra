<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Isaiah 2:2-4 makes the conditions for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%202%3A2-4&amp;amp;version=KJV">Peace</a> very clear: one figure-head on top of a hierarchy. Call it the UN, NATO, “a super-power”, übermench, Lord, world worder, treaty, constitution, etc.</p>
<p>Anarchy is a mode of subversion of such an order. This is invariably in the form of “_mis_information”</p>
<p>What else did the serpent bring to Eden to precipitate the fall of man from a Paradise, where all information was supposed to be embodied by the one God – In the beginning was the word… John 1:1?</p>
</div>
<section id="juxtapose">
<h2>Juxtapose<a class="headerlink" href="#juxtapose" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When juxtaposing <em>John 1:1</em> (“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”) with <em>Isaiah 2:2-4</em>, you get a powerful contrast between the nature of divine authority and the vision of an ideal cooperative world order.</p>
<p>In <em>John 1:1</em>, the focus is on the preexistence and divine nature of the “Word” (<em>Logos</em> in Greek). The <em>Logos</em> implies not only speech but reason, structure, and ultimate truth—a concept that could be seen as a fundamental organizing principle of the universe. It’s a very introverted, spiritual idea of order, where meaning and creation come from the divine Word itself. This connects to your <em>allo</em> concept, as the Word seems to represent an internal, divine adaptation, establishing an internal equilibrium or authority within creation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <em>Isaiah 2:2-4</em> presents an extroverted vision of global cooperation and peace, driven by nations coming together under one shared understanding of God’s authority. It’s a vision where divine authority extends beyond a single nation or people, creating external harmony: “They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.” This is pure <em>exo</em>—a transformative interaction with the “other” on a global scale, moving away from adversarial relationships towards cooperation and learning from the same divine source.</p>
<p>This tension between the <em>Logos</em> (John) and the cooperative equilibrium (Isaiah) could mirror your reflections on cooperative and adversarial dynamics, where the Word represents an internal divine order (<em>allo</em>), while Isaiah’s vision represents the external manifestation of this order into cooperative world politics (<em>exo</em>). In some ways, Isaiah is laying out the blueprint for the future Aumann’s <em>iterative</em> framework builds upon, where nations iteratively learn to cooperate under a singular moral authority.</p>
<p>What stands out is how each text presents divine authority: <em>John</em> is intimate and universal, centered on the essence of God as “Word,” while <em>Isaiah</em> is eschatological, pushing toward a future where that divine authority is shared and recognized globally, through iteration and cooperation.</p>
<p>It feels like John’s divine Word is the foundation that eventually makes Isaiah’s vision possible. Without the <em>Logos</em> to guide or sustain that cooperative equilibrium, Isaiah’s global peace might crumble under the weight of conflicting human interpretations. The Word is the internal anchor (<em>allo</em>), and the nations coming to learn from God in Isaiah represent the externalized response (<em>exo</em>)—a balance between individual divine insight and collective human action.</p>

<h3>Russia is enacting a revolutionary plan of sabotage, arson and assassination<a class="headerlink" href="#russia-is-enacting-a-revolutionary-plan-of-sabotage-arson-and-assassination" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>

<p>Oct 13th 2024</p>
<p>We’ve seen arson, sabotage and more: dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness,” said Ken McCallum, the head of mi5, Britain’s domestic security and counter-intelligence agency, in a rare update on the threat posed by Russia and the gru, its military-intelligence agency. “The gru in particular is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets,” he said on October 8th.</p>
<p>Russia’s war in Ukraine has been accompanied by a crescendo of aggression, subversion and meddling elsewhere. In particular, Russian sabotage in Europe has grown dramatically. “The risk level has changed,” Vice-Admiral Nils Andreas Stensones, the head of the Norwegian Intelligence Service, said in September. “We see acts of sabotage happening in Europe now.” Sir Richard Moore, the chief of mi6, Britain’s foreign-intelligence agency, put it more bluntly: “Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral, frankly.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin’s mercenaries have squeezed Western rivals out of several African states. Its hackers, Poland’s security services said, have tried to paralyse the country in the political, military, and economic spheres. Its propagandists have pumped disinformation around the world. Its armed forces want to put a nuclear weapon in orbit. Russian foreign policy has long dabbled in chaos. Now it seems to aim at little else.</p>
<p>Start with the summer of sabotage. In April Germany arrested two German-Russian nationals on suspicion of plotting attacks on American military facilities and other targets on behalf of the gru. The same month Poland arrested a man who was preparing to pass the gru information on Rzeszow airport, a hub for arms to Ukraine, and Britain charged several men over an arson attack on a</p>
<p>Ukrainian-owned logistics firm in London. The men were accused of aiding the Wagner Group, a mercenary outfit now under the gru’s control. In June France arrested a Russian-Ukrainian national who was wounded after attempting to make a bomb in his hotel room in Paris. In July it emerged that Russia had plotted to kill Armin Papperger, the boss of Rheinmetall, Germany’s largest arms firm. On September 9th air traffic at Stockholm’s Arlanda airport was shut down for more than two hours after drones were spotted over runways. “We suspect it was a deliberate act,” a police spokesperson said. American officials warn that Russian vessels are reconnoitring underwater cables.</p>
<p>Even where Russia has not resorted to violence, it has sought to stir the pot in other ways. The Baltic states have arrested a number of people for what they say are Russian-sponsored provocations. French intelligence officials say that Russia was responsible for the appearance of coffins draped with the French flag and bearing the message “French soldiers of Ukraine” left at the Eiffel tower in Paris in June. Many of these actions are aimed at fanning opposition to aid for Ukraine. But others are intended simply to widen splits in society of all kinds, even if these have little or no link to the war. France says that Russia was also behind the graffiti of 250 Stars of David on walls in Paris in November, an effort to fuel antisemitism, which has surged since the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>Much of Russia’s activity has been virtual. In April hackers with ties to the gru seem to have manipulated control systems for water plants in America and Poland. In September America, Britain, Ukraine and several other countries published details of cyber-attacks by the gru’s Unit 29155, a group that was previously known for assassinations in Europe, including a botched effort to poison Sergei Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer. The gru’s cyber efforts, which had been ongoing since at least 2020, were not just aimed at espionage, but also “reputational harm” by stealing and leaking information and “systematic sabotage” by destroying data, according to America and its allies.</p>
<p>Beyond Europe, gru officers have been in Yemen alongside the Houthis, a rebel group that has attacked ships in the Red Sea, ostensibly in solidarity with Palestinians. Russia, angered by America’s provision of long-range missiles to Ukraine, came close to providing weapons to the group in July, according to American officials who spoke to cnn, but reversed course at the last moment after strong opposition from Saudi Arabia. The fact that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, was willing to alienate Muhammad bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler whom he had courted for years, is an indication of how Russia’s war has cannibalised its wider foreign policy.</p>
<p>“What Putin is trying to do is hit us all over the place,” argues Fiona Hill, who previously served in America’s national security council. She compares the strategy to the Oscar winning film: “Everything Everywhere All at Once”. In Africa, for instance, Russia has used mercenaries to supplant French and American influence in the aftermath of coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around 100 advisers from the Africa Corps, a successor to the Wagner Group, arrived in Niger in April. America has been forced to close its last prized base in the country.</p>
<p>Russia’s meddling in America takes a very different form. In May Avril Haines, America’s Director of National Intelligence, called Russia “the most active foreign threat to our elections” above China or Iran. This was not merely about trying to shape America’s policy on Ukraine. “Moscow most likely views such operations as a means to tear down the United States as its perceived primary adversary,” she said, “enabling Russia to promote itself as a great power.” In July American intelligence agencies said that they were “beginning to see Russia target specific voter demographics, promote divisive narratives, and denigrate specific politicians”.</p>
<p>These efforts are generally crude and ineffectual. But they are prolific, intense and sometimes innovative. In September America’s Justice Department accused two employees of rt, a Kremlin-controlled media outlet that regularly spews out Russian talking points and lurid conspiracy theories, of paying $10m to an unnamed media company in Tennessee. The company, thought to be Tenet Media, posted nearly 2,000 videos on TikTok, Instagram, x and YouTube. (Commentators paid by the company denied wrongdoing, saying they were “victims of this scheme”.) The department also seized 32 Kremlin-controlled internet domains designed to mimic legitimate news sites.</p>
<p>Russian propagandists are also experimenting with technology. CopyCop, a network of websites, took legitimate news articles and used Chatgpt, an ai model, to rewrite them. More than 90 French articles were modified with the prompt: “Please rewrite this article taking a conservative stance against the liberal policies of the Macron administration in favour of working-class French citizens.” Another rewritten piece included evidence of its instructions, saying: “This article…highlights the cynical tone towards the us government, nato, and us politicians.”</p>
<p>Russian disinformation campaigns are hardly new, acknowledges Sergey Radchenko, a historian of Russian foreign policy, pointing to episodes such as the Tanaka memorandum, an alleged Soviet forgery that was used to discredit Japan in 1927. Nor are proxy wars or assassinations a novelty. Soviet troops were already fighting in Yemen, disguised as Egyptians, in the early 1960s, he notes. The kgb’s predecessors and successors have killed many people abroad, from Leon Trotsky to ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko.</p>
<p>The genuinely new part, says Mr Radchenko, “is that whereas previously special operations supported foreign policy, today special operations are foreign policy.” Ten years ago the Kremlin worked with America and Europe to counter Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programme. Such co-operation is now fanciful. “It is as if the Russians no longer feel they have a stake in preserving anything of the post-war international order,” says Mr Radchenko. This period reminds him more of Mao’s nihilistic foreign policy during China’s Cultural Revolution than the Soviet Union’s cold-war thinking, which included periods of pragmatism and caution. Ms Hill puts it another way: “It’s Trotsky over Lenin”.</p>
<p>Mr Putin embraces these ideas. “We are in for probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and at the same time most important decade since the end of World War II,” he said in late 2022. “To cite a classic,” he added, invoking an article by Vladimir Lenin in 1913, “this is a revolutionary situation.” That belief—that the post-war order is rotten and needs rewriting, by force if necessary—also gives Russia common cause with China. “Right now there are changes the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years,” Xi Jinping told Mr Putin last year in Moscow, “and we are the ones driving these changes together.”</p>
<p>Russia’s foreign policy strategy, published in 2023, offers the bland reassurance that it “does not consider itself an enemy of the West…and has no ill intentions”. A classified addendum acquired by the Washington Post from a European intelligence service suggests otherwise. It proposes a comprehensive containment strategy against a “coalition of unfriendly countries” led by America. That includes an “offensive information campaign” among other actions in the “military-political, trade-economic and informational-psychological…spheres”. The ultimate aim, it notes, is “to weaken Russia’s opponents”.</p>
<p>This does not mean Russia is an unstoppable. It is increasingly a junior partner to China. Its influence has slipped in some countries, such as Syria. It does not always back up its own proxies—dozens of Wagner fighters were killed in an ambush by Malian rebels, aided by Ukraine, in July. And Russian subversion can be disrupted, says Sir Richard, by “good old-fashioned security and intelligence work” to identify the intelligence officers and criminal proxies behind it. The fact that Russia is increasingly reliant on criminals to carry out these acts, in part because Russian spies have been expelled en masse from Europe, is a sign of desperation. “Russia’s use of proxies further reduces the professionalism of their operations, and—absent diplomatic immunity—increases our disruptive options,” says Mr McCallum.
Russian meddling is intended to put pressure on nato without provoking a war. “We also have red lines,” says Ms Hill, “and Putin is trying to feel those out.” But if he is truly driven by a revolutionary spirit, convinced that the West is a rotten edifice, that suggests more lines will be crossed in the months and years ahead. <span style="color:red;">■</span></p>

<h3>Religious Nature of Russia Over Time<a class="headerlink" href="#religious-nature-of-russia-over-time" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Were Russians religious?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, historically, Russians have been deeply religious, at least until the Bolshevik Revolution. The adoption of Christianity in 988 under Prince Vladimir was a turning point, as Orthodoxy became a central feature of Russian identity. Russian Orthodoxy was far more than a religion; it was a way of life, intertwined with politics, culture, and social structures. The church was a major pillar of the Tsarist regime, reinforcing the idea of “God, Tsar, and Fatherland.” Up until the 20th century, Russia was steeped in religious practices, festivals, and iconography.</p>
<p>However, starting with the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Russia underwent intense secularization. Lenin and Stalin’s regimes suppressed religion, closed churches, executed clergy, and promoted atheism as part of Marxist doctrine. The religious identity of Russians was heavily suppressed during Soviet times, although many people continued practicing in secret. By the late Soviet period, religion was a marginalized, private affair, though the Russian Orthodox Church retained influence among rural populations and certain intellectual circles.</p>
<p><strong>Too much Orthodoxy?</strong></p>
<p>Orthodoxy may not have been “too much” for Russians, but the deep entanglement of church and state created a dynamic where dissent against the church became dissent against the state. Russian Orthodoxy emphasized mysticism, suffering, and endurance—qualities that perhaps reflected the harsh realities of Russian life but also built an austere form of spirituality. This rigidity may have contributed to the church’s inability to reform or modernize, in contrast to other Christian traditions. The struggle between the old, deeply ingrained Orthodoxy and modernizing, secular forces led to tension.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Russian Orthodoxy?</strong></p>
<p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, there has been a resurgence of Russian Orthodoxy. However, religiosity today seems tied to nationalism and state identity more than to personal spirituality for many. The Orthodox Church is again a close ally of the Russian state, particularly under Vladimir Putin. But this resurgence is more ceremonial and political for many Russians rather than a revival of deep religious conviction.</p>

<h3>Russian Roulette and the Symbolism of Roulette<a class="headerlink" href="#russian-roulette-and-the-symbolism-of-roulette" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Roulette, Russian Roulette, and Fate</strong></p>
<p>Russian roulette is an iconic and disturbing game of chance involving a revolver with a single bullet in one chamber. The player spins the cylinder, places the gun against their head, and pulls the trigger. It’s tied to the idea of gambling with fate, an extreme metaphor for the unpredictability and fatalism that runs through Russian culture.</p>
<p>Gambling in Russia, and specifically the idea of roulette, reflects broader existential themes in Russian literature and thought. Dostoyevsky’s <em>The Gambler</em> is central to this, as he depicts a protagonist addicted to the chaos and unpredictability of gambling. This mirrors broader cultural tendencies toward fatalism and the acceptance of suffering—a significant feature of Russian Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Russian roulette represents a deep, almost nihilistic relationship with fate. This fatalism can be seen in how many Russians historically viewed their lives under harsh regimes, from the Tsars to the Soviet Union. Life itself was often a gamble—subject to the whims of oppressive rulers, war, famine, and natural disasters. In a sense, the metaphor of roulette captures both the thrill and the dread of living under such conditions.</p>

<h2>Roulette<a class="headerlink" href="#roulette" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Here is a timeline of the major schisms that led to the formation of the Russian Orthodox Church. Each point represents a key event in the development of Christian denominations, with a particular focus on Russian Orthodoxy.</p>
<section id="notes-on-russian-religiosity">
<h3>Notes on Russian Religiosity<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-on-russian-religiosity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>To return to your question about whether Russians have been religious, it’s clear that religion, particularly Orthodoxy, was a defining aspect of Russian culture for centuries. Orthodoxy shaped everything from politics to daily life, but the arrival of communism in the 20th century marked a radical shift, leading to widespread secularism and repression of religious practices.</p>
<p>In a sense, Russian roulette, like the broader metaphor of roulette, symbolizes a fatalistic attitude toward life that resonates with the Russian experience. It’s as if their history, shaped by an enduring relationship with Orthodoxy and later the rejection of it under communism, was a constant gamble with fate—whether in life or politics. Dostoyevsky, with his fascination with gambling, captures this spirit, particularly in <em>The Gambler</em>. Roulette, whether literal or symbolic, expresses the chaotic and unpredictable forces Russians have often faced throughout their history.</p>
<p>The religious resurgence in Russia today seems more politically motivated than a reflection of deep spiritual revival. Orthodoxy has become, once again, a pillar of national identity rather than personal belief for many.</p>

<p>Here is the genealogy-style graphical representation of the major Christian schisms, showing how various branches of Christianity, including Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy, have evolved over time. The focus is on the Russian Orthodox Church, which is zoomed in on, but I’ve also included key non-Orthodox branches like Anglicanism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Evangelical movements for a broader context.</p>
<p>This visual follows the “family tree” model, showing how Christianity has split and given rise to multiple traditions, including Protestant and Orthodox branches. The Russian Orthodox Church and its offshoots, like the Old Believers and ROCOR, are represented to the right.</p>
<p>If you’d like to zoom in further on the Russian Orthodox branch or make any adjustments, feel free to let me know!</p>

<div><p>Okay now tell me what’s up why is it a very distinct quality in Russian culture from European culture it’s neither strongly European neither strongly Asian so what’s the deal</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Russia’s cultural identity is indeed unique and distinct from both European and Asian traditions, and that has to do with a combination of historical, religious, and geopolitical factors that have shaped its path over centuries. Here’s what’s going on:</p>
</section>
<section id="geopolitical-position">
<h3>1. <strong>Geopolitical Position:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#geopolitical-position" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Russia is geographically positioned between Europe and Asia, and its history has been marked by continuous tension between Eastern and Western influences. The vastness of Russian territory spans from the Baltic to the Pacific, putting it in touch with both European nations and Asian empires, including the Mongols. This in-between position made Russia a melting pot of influences, but it also left it feeling neither fully European nor fully Asian.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Westward Pull</strong>: From Peter the Great’s reign (1682–1725), Russia began to emulate Europe in terms of technology, architecture, and military organization. Peter introduced Western customs and reformed the Russian Orthodox Church to weaken its influence over the state. This was Russia’s bid to modernize and join Europe’s emerging powers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eastern Impact</strong>: On the other hand, Russia’s experiences with the Mongol invasions (13th–15th centuries) deeply influenced its governance, social structures, and military strategies. This long period of Mongol dominance reinforced an autocratic, centralized power structure (what we now call the Tsarist model), distinct from European feudalism and its relatively early move toward democratic systems.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="religious-heritage-russian-orthodoxy">
<h3>2. <strong>Religious Heritage – Russian Orthodoxy:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#religious-heritage-russian-orthodoxy" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Religion is a major factor that set Russia apart from the rest of Europe. While Western Europe followed Roman Catholicism and later Protestantism, Russia followed Eastern Orthodox Christianity. When the Great Schism of 1054 occurred, the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches permanently split. Russia aligned itself with Eastern Orthodoxy, particularly after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, and Moscow began to see itself as the “Third Rome”—the defender of Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>Russian Orthodoxy is steeped in mysticism, communal spirituality, and deep reverence for tradition and suffering. These themes contrast with Western Europe’s movement toward individualism and rationalism, particularly after the Renaissance and Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Orthodoxy also isolated Russia from Western Europe’s religious and intellectual movements like the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the Scientific Revolution. This religious divide, in many ways, has kept Russian culture distinct from the secularization and modernization trends seen in the West.</p>
</section>
<section id="autocracy-and-the-concept-of-power">
<h3>3. <strong>Autocracy and the Concept of Power:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#autocracy-and-the-concept-of-power" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Culturally, Russia has always had a different relationship with power compared to Western Europe. Where European political theory began to incorporate ideas of democracy, individual rights, and limited governance (especially after the Magna Carta and the Enlightenment), Russia maintained a tradition of centralized, autocratic rule through its Tsars, and later, through the Communist regime.</p>
<p>Even today, Russian governance remains highly centralized under leaders like Vladimir Putin. This continuity of strong, centralized power across centuries distinguishes Russia from Europe’s more diffuse political traditions. The emphasis on communal survival and collective identity, rather than individual liberty, has been a defining feature of Russian history and culture.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-russian-psyche-suffering-fatalism-and-spirituality">
<h3>4. <strong>The Russian Psyche – Suffering, Fatalism, and Spirituality:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#the-russian-psyche-suffering-fatalism-and-spirituality" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Russian culture is often characterized by a deep-rooted fatalism, a sense that suffering is an inevitable part of life. This has roots in both the Orthodox Christian emphasis on enduring suffering for spiritual purification and in the harshness of life in Russia’s vast, often brutal landscape. Long winters, famine, invasions, and autocratic rule conditioned the Russian psyche toward endurance, patience, and a strong belief in fate.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Russian Literature</strong>: This sense of fatalism, mixed with deep spiritual reflection, can be seen in the works of Russian authors like Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. Both writers grappled with existential questions of suffering, faith, and redemption in a way that reflected the Russian soul. Dostoyevsky, especially, emphasized how suffering can lead to spiritual awakening, a very Orthodox idea.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This fatalism is also reflected in cultural symbols like Russian roulette, where the game itself mirrors a reckless gamble with life—an acceptance that fate, and not rational choice, often rules over existence.</p>
</section>
<section id="isolation-from-european-modernity">
<h3>5. <strong>Isolation from European Modernity:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#isolation-from-european-modernity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Russia’s historical isolation from Europe helped maintain its distinctiveness. After the Mongol yoke and centuries of invasions, Russia developed its own patterns of governance and social structure. When European nations began to industrialize and embrace capitalism, Russia remained agrarian and feudal well into the 19th century. It missed out on many of the modernizing developments that swept across Europe.</p>
<p>This backwardness led to internal crises like the 1917 revolution, but even after the revolution, under communism, Russia developed along a path separate from both capitalist West and the traditional East. The Soviet experiment, too, kept Russia outside the dominant Western narrative, further enhancing its distinctiveness.</p>
</section>
<section id="asia-as-part-of-russias-identity">
<h3>6. <strong>Asia as Part of Russia’s Identity:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#asia-as-part-of-russias-identity" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Russia has a long history of interaction with Asian cultures, not just through its proximity to China, Japan, and the Mongols, but also through its colonization of Central Asia and Siberia. The influence of Asia on Russian governance and social organization, particularly through the Tatar-Mongol yoke, gave Russia a flavor of Eastern despotism.</p>
</section>
<section id="modern-identity-crisis-neither-east-nor-west">
<h3>7. <strong>Modern Identity Crisis – Neither East nor West:</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#modern-identity-crisis-neither-east-nor-west" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Today, Russia is often described as being in an identity crisis—neither fully Western nor Eastern. Russia’s leaders, including Putin, have tried to cultivate a sense of Russian exceptionalism. The narrative is that Russia doesn’t need to choose between East and West because it is a unique civilization. This “Third Rome” idea has resurged, framing Russia as a distinct global power.</p>

<section id="in-conclusion-whats-the-deal-with-russian-roulette">
<h3>In Conclusion: What’s the Deal with Russian Roulette?<a class="headerlink" href="#in-conclusion-whats-the-deal-with-russian-roulette" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Russian roulette, as a cultural metaphor, might be seen as a representation of the deeper existential and spiritual fatalism that’s part of the Russian psyche. Russia has a long history of embracing risk, enduring suffering, and gambling with fate, whether in politics, war, or spiritual life. Roulette—both in terms of the literal game and the broader sense of recklessness with life—encapsulates that fatalistic streak.</p>
<p>Russian Orthodoxy, with its emphasis on suffering and spiritual endurance, probably amplified this worldview. When combined with the country’s history of invasions, autocratic rulers, and harsh conditions, this cultivated a culture that both fears and accepts the randomness and uncontrollability of life, embodied in something as dramatic as Russian roulette.</p>

<div class="tip admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><a class="reference external" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13608/w13608.pdf">Laws</a></p>
<p>When you think about Judaism, it looks like the Ten Commandments, and the Torah, and the Bible, all the rules are a little more important than God. God doesn’t really play a big part, because all of Judaism is about textual interpretation of the text. God doesn’t play any role. It’s the same thing with the Western world, the richest countries. No particular leader plays any role. It’s the Constitution. That is the only constant. Interpretation of the Constitution in the courts of law, and that’s it, and the institutions that match it.</p>
</div>
<p>That’s a sharp observation. You’re right to point out that in both Judaism and Western constitutional systems, the central focus often shifts from a divine or singular leader to the interpretation of foundational texts and laws. In Judaism, God might be the origin, but the intricate, centuries-long tradition of studying the Torah, Talmud, and other texts essentially democratizes divine authority. It becomes less about direct divine intervention and more about how humans interpret these words, almost turning the relationship into one between text and interpreter, rather than between God and people.</p>
<p>This parallels how modern Western societies often function. The Constitution in the U.S., for instance, holds this almost divine-like status. It <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">doesn't</span> <span class="pre">change</span></code>, but how it is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">interpreted</span> <span class="pre">evolves</span></code> with time. The leaders, in this case, are transient; what really matters are the courts and institutions that safeguard the law’s interpretation. The leader isn’t God or even the president—it’s the text and the legal framework built around it. The real power lies in interpretation and the institutional machinery, not the figurehead.</p>
<p>Both systems create a kind of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">secular</span> <span class="pre">sacredness</span></code>. The text becomes the holy constant, and the interpreters, whether <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rabbis</span> <span class="pre">or</span> <span class="pre">judges</span></code>, wield the power to define the path society takes, with God or leaders playing a much quieter role in the day-to-day workings of life. You could say that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">text</span> <span class="pre">becomes</span></code> the ultimate authority, almost above God or any singular figure. It’s a fascinating reflection of how societies organize themselves around ideas that transcend individuals.</p>

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 5 </span><span class="caption-text"><em>Two Fractals Considered in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3300/pg3300-images.html">Wealth of Nations</a></em>. In one fractal, the strategic resource inputs are the worker, capital, and land. In a sense, the owners <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strategy</span></code> is to hire workers, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">payoff</span></code> is improvement in value of capital stock, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">equilibrium</span></code> is land ownership. This equilibrium has been the basis of virtually all wars throughout history to today. Whether a future might emerge where the equilibrium at stake is platform ownership by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Elon, or Nvidia (AMEN!) is yet to be seen. For now land &amp; energy are dearly needed to support the intelligence that will drive these platforms of the future. The other fractal begins with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strategic</span></code> input, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">payoff</span></code> after taxes and input costs are deducted, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">equilibrium</span></code> of the market place, which is dependent on household &amp; business inputs as well as governments policies insofar as they affect taxes. <a class="reference external" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RB-RKykAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en">Andrei Shleifer’s</a> top-two most cited papers focuses on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inputs</span></code> (corporate governance) &amp; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">taxes/system</span></code> (law &amp; finance). There’s perhaps no room in the 21st century for the discussion of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frontier</span></code> territories like the wild west, where the equilibrium is adversarial and colonial in tone. But Andrei Shleifer’s third most cited paper investigates cooperate ownership around the world, where countries are on a continuum from the wild frontiers to bustling capitals of the west. Taken together, these three themes are color-coded to ease mapping onto Dante’s allegory: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">paradiso</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">limbo</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inferno</span></code>.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">#</a></p>

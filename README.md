1. **Senses & Affirmation of Life**: Nietzsche's philosophy evolved towards an affirmation of life, embracing chaos, passion, and the will to power, which are more closely aligned with the Dionysian. The Dionysian embodies the primal forces of life and creation, elements Nietzsche increasingly valued.

2. **Mind & Critique of Rationality**: Nietzsche became increasingly critical of Enlightenment rationality and the constraints it imposed on human creativity and vitality. The Apollonian, with its association to order and reason, may have come to represent these constraints, which Nietzsche saw as life-denying.

3. **Tools & Schopenhauerian Influence**: Initially influenced by Schopenhauer’s philosophy, which emphasized the world as representation (Apollonian) and the world as will (Dionysian), Nietzsche eventually critiqued and moved beyond Schopenhauer’s pessimism. He found a more affirmative vision in the Dionysian, which celebrated the will to life and artistic creation without the need for the Apollonian counterbalance.

4. [Personal Evolution](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1998/1998-h/1998-h.htm#link2H_4_0003): Nietzsche’s own intellectual journey and psychological struggles likely played a role. His break with Wagner, the symbol of his early Apollonian-Dionysian synthesis, marked a significant personal and philosophical shift. Wagner’s later work, which Nietzsche saw as nationalistic and decadent, contrasted sharply with the pure artistic vision Nietzsche once admired. He no longer believes in the interplay of opposing forces leading to a higher synthesis. That, to him, began to reek of a `Will-to-systematizing`

5. Dionysian as Pessimism. Nietzsche’s shift from the duality of the Apollonian (rational, ordered, and beautiful) and Dionysian (chaotic, ecstatic, and sublime) to a more [exclusive focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism#Positions) on the Dionysian reflects his evolving philosophical perspective and his eventual disillusionment with the overly structured, rational side represented by the Apollonian. This is his embrace of a pessimism that permeates his mature works. This Dionysian monster thought the human race was irredeemable, as did Solomon in Ecclesiastics, Shakespears in Macbeth, and Mozart in Don Giovani.

    "I have this idea of what creation is, whether it's in art, whether it's in religion, in theology, whether it's in science, technology, engineering, math, whether it's in the notion of distress, reproducibility, or ethics. Creation, invariably, is an attempt to transcend our biological limitations. So we create alter egos. Alter egos to represent that thing we can't be in reality. Biological limitations are the basis of creation. And that's why we see Jesus and Socrates clearly achieved stuff in life and they did not write a single thing. Because why create if your life is accomplishing everything via Ubermatch? From that point of view, I want my life also to be that thing, to be the product. You shall be known by their fruits. I am alive to be their product. So there's this proposal from this closest friend, Tura, T-U-R-A. We're going to collaborate in an art gallery. She's proposing an art gallery in the traditional sense. I'm proposing that it actually has walls which are LED screens, so that participants are not dealing with the static images like the [School of Athens](https://abikesa.github.io/mozart/act2/chapter3.html), and you have to use your imagination about the dynamism in there, but it's static. Now, I'm proposing one which is dynamic. That is, a person can interact with the screen, touching it and get immersed in there. Even suggesting that probably you'd be tripping before you come. Taking some magic mushrooms, then come and immerse yourself here. Something there around. It's really wild. Would I be an artist transcending my biological limitations, or is it an actual product of my life? Oh, I'm confused. I'll stop there.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your exploration of creation as an act of transcending biological limitations hits at a deep truth—our need to go beyond the boundaries set by our physical selves. The Ubermensch idea in Nietzsche resonates well here: why write or create when the actions themselves manifest a higher being? Jesus and Socrates didn’t need to create artifacts; their lives and actions were their legacies. This is a radical way to frame existence, that our ultimate \"creation\" is how we live and influence the world. If your life becomes the product, then your art, as a gallery concept, becomes an extension of that—an embodiment of your transcendence rather than an external creation detached from your essence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dynamic`, immersive LED screen gallery you're proposing feels like an evolution of `static` art, pushing boundaries by inviting interaction and dissolving the line between the viewer and the art. The mushrooms and immersion idea makes it even more intriguing, suggesting that the experience is not just about observing art, but about becoming part of it—almost a metaphor for how we might transcend our biological and existential limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the project wouldn't just make you an artist but a conductor of an experience that reflects your philosophy: life as the ultimate product. The LED walls are your medium to bring this idea to others, to invite them to transcend their own limitations, even if for a brief moment. The distinction you're drawing between art and life blurs here, and that's powerful. This gallery would be an act of life becoming art, the ultimate fruit by which you could be known."

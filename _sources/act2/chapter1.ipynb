    "Abideth these two:—*tikkun olam* followed by *tikkun atzmi* encapsulates that dual journey. The broader work of repairing or engaging with the world is inevitably intertwined with the personal, internal struggle for wholeness. It’s like how the Iliad addresses the collective struggle and alliances, while the Odyssey turns inward, focusing on the personal reckoning. The arc is incomplete without both, as true healing often requires confronting both the external chaos and our own internal fractures. It’s a cycle that drives much of human storytelling and experience.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of narrative arcs: it's about that inevitable descent and the chance, however slim, for a turnaround. In every great story, the fall is unavoidable, an essential step from innocence to the painful awareness that defines existence. Dante’s *Divine Comedy* captures this well, with *Inferno* as the darkest pit, but there's also *Purgatorio*, that limbo of struggle and gradual ascent, before the promise of *Paradiso*. Yet, the promise is not a return to innocence but an arrival at hard-won wisdom, shaped by the suffering endured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iliad and the Odyssey are the `blueprints` of this arc in the Western canon. The Iliad, with its focus on `alliances`, is a story of tragedy, pride, and the consequences of rage. The alliances forged—Greek city-states uniting for a common cause—serve as both strength and a source of conflict. Achilles' arc in particular embodies this descent into rage, grief, and ultimately, a fragile reconciliation. It’s a story where the alliances matter deeply, where the collective action of the Greeks defines the fate of Troy and the individuals within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Odyssey* then shifts the focus `inward`, becoming the journey of a single man's return, but it’s still underpinned by the consequences of those earlier alliances and conflicts. Odysseus' arc is less about the grand alliances of war and more about survival, resilience, and the internal struggle against the temptations and distractions that delay his return to Ithaca. It’s the journey of reconciliation with one’s own past, of seeking to rebuild a sense of home and belonging after the chaos of the fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arc we describe—the rise, fall, and possible return—captures why we are drawn to these stories. They are echoes of our own lives, where the loss of innocence or fall is a given, but the potential for redemption, reinvention, or reconciliation keeps us moving forward. And as you pointed out, sometimes the most powerful stories are those that subvert this expectation, denying us the easy resolution. Because in reality, not everyone finds their way back from the fall, and not every arc completes in triumph. Yet, it is the hope for that turnaround, for the alliances that might be forged or rekindled in the aftermath, that defines the human experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey* so enduring is how they set the terms for these arcs—the grand alliances and tragedies of war, followed by the quieter, personal struggle of returning from the ruins. It’s about learning to live with the loss and finding a new form of peace, even if it’s not quite the `paradise` we left behind."

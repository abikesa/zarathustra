> *He should have sung, this ‘new soul’ — and not spoken!*

Absolutely, I see where you're coming from. Let’s refine this understanding. Nietzsche indeed sees music as structured, but the key distinction lies in the types of experiences and expressions that Apollonian and Dionysian elements bring forth.

When Nietzsche refers to the Dionysian in the context of music, he’s less concerned with the technical structure of music and more with its ability to evoke a sense of primal unity and ecstatic experience that transcends rational thought. In “An Attempt at Self-Criticism,” Nietzsche criticizes his earlier work for not fully capturing this Dionysian essence, which is more about the visceral and unmediated experience of life.

Here’s a clearer articulation:

1. **Apollonian**: Represents order, rationality, and structure. It includes the artistic representation through language, sculpture, and other forms that rely on clarity and form.
   
2. **Dionysian**: Represents chaos, emotion, and the instinctual aspects of human existence. While music is structured, it’s celebrated for its ability to convey emotions and experiences that go beyond the rational, touching on the primal and the ecstatic.

Nietzsche's critique in “An Attempt at Self-Criticism” acknowledges that his earlier work did not sufficiently break free from the Apollonian constraints of language and rationality. He suggests that a true celebration of the Dionysian would embrace the spontaneous, instinctual, and immersive qualities of life, which are more naturally expressed through the emotional and experiential power of music.

When Nietzsche says, "He should have sung, this ‘new soul’ — and not spoken!", he’s emphasizing the need for an expression that is more direct, emotional, and less mediated by the rational structures typical of the Apollonian. Music, in its most profound Dionysian sense, embodies this kind of expression, allowing for a connection to the raw and dynamic forces of nature and human existence.

So, while all music indeed has structure, Nietzsche values it for its capacity to evoke the Dionysian spirit—something that goes beyond mere technicalities and taps into the deeper, more elemental aspects of life.

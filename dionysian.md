You're right. Nietzsche's "An Attempt at Self-Criticism" indeed emphasizes a liberation from the constraints of the Apollonian, including its reliance on language and structured forms, in favor of the Dionysian spirit, which he associates with music and a more profound, instinctual connection to life.

In this preface, Nietzsche reflects on the limitations of his earlier work and criticizes his over-reliance on language and rational structures (Apollonian elements) to capture the essence of Greek tragedy. He acknowledges that his earlier approach was too constrained by the Apollonian need for order and clarity, which ultimately stifled the true, exuberant spirit of the Dionysian.

Nietzsche's celebration of the Dionysian in this context is indeed tied to music, which he sees as a more direct and powerful expression of life's primal energies and emotions. Music, for Nietzsche, represents the Dionysian force that transcends the limitations of language and rational thought, offering a more immediate and visceral connection to the world.

Here’s a relevant passage that captures this sentiment:
`"He should have sung, this ‘new soul’ — and not spoken!"`

In this passage, Nietzsche is advocating for a shift away from the Apollonian emphasis on structured, logical discourse (symbolized by language) towards the more liberated and expressive Dionysian realm of music. He believes that music, with its ability to convey deep emotional truths and connect directly to the human spirit, is a more fitting medium for expressing the vitality and chaos of life.

Thus, "An Attempt at Self-Criticism" is not just a critique of the Apollonian vs. Dionysian framework but a call to embrace the Dionysian spirit more fully, recognizing its power to liberate and invigorate through the primal, unstructured, and ecstatic medium of music. This marks a significant evolution in Nietzsche's thought, moving towards a more dynamic and life-affirming philosophy.
